              Hi, I‚Äôm Anthony with a background in Computer Networking and a
              penchant for clean code, I specialize in crafting delightful user
              experiences. My toolkit includes HTML, CSS (with a flair for
              responsive design), JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, React, and
              React Native. I‚Äôm also a fan of the utility-first approach with
              Tailwind CSS. I‚Äôve had the privilege of working on diverse
              projects. From e-commerce websites that adapt seamlessly across
              devices to interactive web apps that engage users, I thrive on
              turning ideas into reality. One of my proudest achievements was
              optimizing a landing page, resulting in a 30% increase in
              conversion rates.
