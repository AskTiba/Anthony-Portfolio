              I’ve spent a couple of decades creating brands <br /> and digital
              products and obsessing over what <br /> makes them fly. I have a
              creative studio called <br /> The Workshop and invest in
              early-stage ventures <br /> — collaborating on brave ideas with
              amazing <br /> people.

              I partner with venture <br /> capital and accelerators <br /> —
              helping shape <br />
              investments as a Design <br /> Director.

              I focus on early-stage design — taking a brand <br /> from zero to
              one. My work helps companies make <br /> strategic decisions in
              their foundational stages <br /> and leverage their position in
              the market. Over the <br /> past few years, I’ve helped build four
              startups and <br /> my work has led to over $55M in investment.
